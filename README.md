# Credit Card Fraud Detection System
## Overview
This project implements a hybrid machine learning model for credit card fraud detection using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 
It demonstrates the use of both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to identify potential fraudulent transactions in credit card applications.

## Features
Unsupervised learning with Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for initial fraud detection
Supervised learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to refine fraud predictions
Data preprocessing and feature scaling
Visualization of SOM results

## Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
MiniSom
